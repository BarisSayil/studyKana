The Japanese writing system consists of kanji, the characters burrowed from Chinese, and kana, two syllabic scripts. These scripts are the cursive hiragana (ひらがな) and the angular katakana (カタカナ). While hiragana is ubiquitous in the language and therefore quite hard to forget, katakana is not. I realized last week that I had basically forgotten to read the katakana so I wrote this program.
This program is not useful for learning the kana but rather to check your knowledge. In passive mode you type the pronunciation of the given kana and you find out if you were correct or not. In active mode you're shown the pronunciation of a kana and you're expected to write it on a piece of paper. Later you press enter to see the answer. If you got it correct you press enter again to get to the next kana, otherwise you should type something (e.g. a random letter) and then press enter.
The lists are randomized through random module's shuffle method so as to not develop dependencies on the order. After you go through the list you're shown your mistakes. If you made too many mistakes you can launch the program again and try again. If however you only made a couple mistakes you should study those few kana and for a few minutes, wait 10 minutes, and then launch it again. Obviously you can modify these steps to your liking. Good luck.
